# tfKeras-cheatsheet
I have been recently working intensively with tensorflow/keras for my master's thesis and I have gathered code that if I knew before it could have saved me some time. More importantly, altough useful for someone, reading huge explainations before the code that I quickly need, really does not work for me. I will try to update this repository constantly with good stuff. I hope it will help!
